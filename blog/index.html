    <h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>
    <p>This is my Blog. This is where I will chronicle my experiences on this coding journey of mine. They will be updated as the weeks go on over the 7 week period.</p>
    <h2>January 21-27,</h2>
    <p>Even though the week has past and is already over and done with, it was still an intense week as that week specifically was the start of my journey as a coder. When the classes started on the 23rd it was a rocky start (at least for me anyway) but as the week went on it stated to smooth out and get better. By Satuday the 27th I had learned so many things like how to use, create, modify, and move around in my computer's command terminal. I say that week was a busy and interesting week, and I wonder what else is in store as time goes on.</p>
